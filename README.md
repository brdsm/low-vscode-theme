# Low Theme

A light theme with low-key syntax highlighting and a clear, readable UI.

Inspired by William Esz's [A Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esz.theme-a).

## Why?

- I find syntax highlighted with few colors less confusing than syntax highlighted with many colors.
- When syntax highlighting is enabled, muted but easily distinguishable colors look best.
- Light-colored themes tend to make it easier for my eyes to physically focus on the text (astigmatism?).
